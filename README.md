# Sync-vs.-Async
Difference between Sync and Async  

Sync and Async difference:  
Does the person sending the requirements need to wait until the requst is completed before they can operate other things.  

Sync: synchronous(同步) does not mean to process at the same time, but it means to do it step by step.  

Async: asynchronous(非同步) receiving the requestments, it don't have to wait until its are completed before executing other requirements.  

For Example:  
For example, there are three instructions A, B, and C, and in the sync execution order will be A> B> C (you must wait for the execution of the previous instruction to execute the next one)  
Async means that it is not restricted by the incomplete execution of the previous instruction, which means that the instructions after A will not wait for A to finish before execution.  
  
If I'm wrong, I will humbly accept corrections
